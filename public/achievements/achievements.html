            <div class="resume-point">
                <h4>Dean's List</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To obtain the Dean's list, a student must maintain above a 3.5 GPA at the end of the semester</li>
                    <li>I have obtained this status for 50% of the total semesters that I have been at Boston University</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="resume-point">
                <h4>Game Jam</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Game Jam is an event where, with a team, you must develop a video game in a short time period</li>
                    <li>I have participated and placed highly in a variety of these events, sometimes making a game in as
                    fast as 48 hours</li>
                    <li>This achievement forced me to be adaptable, a fast learner, and a good teammate</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="resume-point">
                <h4>Hackathon</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have participated in various Hackathons, while similar to Game Jams, the conditions in these
                    events are quite different.</li>
                    <li>These competitions are normally shorter, sometimes confined to a single day, and I am
                    often partnered with strangers</li>
                    <li>Placing well in these competitions taught me what it takes to develop efficient and valuable
                    software</li>
